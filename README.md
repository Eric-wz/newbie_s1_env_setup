# Step 1: Environment Setup

Welcome! Before you start coding, let's set up your development environment. This involves installing a few essential tools.


## 1. Code Editor

- **Recommendation:** [**Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**](https://code.visualstudio.com/)


## 2. Web Browser

- **Recommendation:** [**Google Chrome**](https://www.google.com/chrome/)


## 3. Version Control System (Git)

- **Recommendation:** [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/)

## 4. Node.js and npm (via NVM)

- **Recommendation:** [**Node Version Manager (NVM)**](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

- **Verify NVM Installation:**
  Open a **new** terminal window and run:

  ```bash
  nvm -v
  ```

- **Install Node.js (Latest LTS):**

  ```bash
  nvm install --lts
  ```

- **Use the Installed Node.js Version:**
  NVM usually automatically uses the version it just installed. To ensure it's active, or to switch later, run:

  ```bash
  nvm use --lts
  ```

- **Verify Node.js and npm Installation:**
  Check that Node.js and npm are installed correctly:
  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```
  You should see the version numbers for both Node.js (matching the LTS you installed) and npm.

## Ready to Go!

Once you have successfully installed and verified all these tools, your development environment is set up. You're ready for the next step!
